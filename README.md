# **Covid19-facemask-detect**

Implementation of a computer vision model for the detection of masks on customers faces.
It was extended later to be used on videos from camera feeds in a large retail shop where alerts were send when customers did not have masks. <br />

## **Usage**

To test out this code;

- Make sure you have a webcam attached to your PC or internal webcam.

Clone the repository <br />

`git clone https://github.com/billmdevs/covid19-facemask-detect`

Enter the `covid19-facemask-detect` directory and run `$ python detect_facemask.py` <br />

Then see what happens on your camera when you are wearing a mask or not :)
